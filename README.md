# Pick up sticks game
Small random number generator game. Mostly works but slight flaw at the end where if you pick up more sticks than what's left, it just makes sticks = 0. <br/>
In pick up sticks, two players take turns to pick up 1, 2 or 3 matchsticks from a pile of 27. The player who picks up the last matchstick loses.
